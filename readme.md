# Cleaner (CICP Plugin)

This CICP plugin allows you to clean a recordset by deleting the duplicate entries.  
This could have been done either in `configLoader` or `recorder` but I decided to not do it for personnal reason.


# How to use it

## Add it to CICP

Install it to your `plugins` folder, then do not forget to add it while launching the cli: `cicp -o configLoader,matcher,cleaner`.   

## Require this plugin from another

Simply add the following object in your `package.json`:

```json
"plugin": {
  "consumes": [
    "cleaner",
  ],
}
```

## Comandline option

This plugin add a new commandline switch `-pc` or `--plug-cleaner`.  
It accept one parameter `recordset`.

Here is an example:  
`cicp --plug-cleaner 'recordset'`.

# Additional Informations

This plugin will generate another recordset with a suffix of `-Cleaned`.

This module use `DEBUG` so feel free to add `DEBUG=cicp:cleaner` to see debug logs.
